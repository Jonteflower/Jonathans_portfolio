After being part of two startups that never managed to get out the door. I founded Tixy-NFT in early 2022 together with my Co-Founders Alrashid and Nora. After spending the previous 5 years of my life juggling parallel degrees, bartending in some of Stockholm's luxurious bars and restaurants, doing assurance at PWC, or managing warehouse logistics. 
\nIt was finally time to take the leap into entrepreneurship, putting my MSc degree in Applied Mathmatics on hold to focus solely on running Tixy-NFT. The immense scope of building, deploying, and running a tech startup taught me more lessons than all my years in school combined. 
\nBeing a part of KTH-Innovation and Sting, was of great benefit when trying to navigate the stormy waters of entrepreneurship. However, the hardest part of launching a tech startup was still left. Actually developing the tech. 
\nBuilding Tixy-NFT by myself in only a couple of months was the hardest thing I've done so far. This also had to be done while simultaneously talking to customers, working with a designer, and pitching to VC firms and Angel investors. My previous experience in web development was close to zero. The same could be said of APIs, cloud computing, front-end, backend, encryption, and everything else that needed to be done in order to actually deploy a fully working beta version of Tixy-NFT. 
\nIn the end, everything worked out, and we launched Tixy-NFT officially in June 2022. Now anyone could deploy buy, sell, transfer and authenticate NFTs without needing a crypto wallet, crypto-currency, or any other knowledge about crypto. Tixy-NFT removed all the complexity by having our own safe, encrypted custodian wallets and by using Stripe to manage the flow of payments between merchants and customers. Buying an NFT could now be done in seconds and then be traded or transferred to any wallet of their choosing. 
\nThe stack used for Tixy-NFT was based on a combination of, Next.Js, Firebase,  and the Google Cloud Platform. The reasoning behind this was the vast amount of documentation available and also the possibility to use the same backend infrastructure for a potential Flutter mobile app.

If I could summarize myself in two words they would definitely be. Forever curious.
\nMy love for technology has always been a constant in my life. From building my first computer to writing my first program, computers, science, and technology have been a source of immense curiosity for me.`

Due to the recent happening in the crypto markets and general economic outlook working in a growth driven "Blockchain" spaced became hard. Billion dollar companies are currently failing left and right in a way that has not been seen since 2008 or maybe more similarly 2001. 
However with economic times worsening new opportunities arise in fields of optimization, recourse allocation and optimization... To be continued
