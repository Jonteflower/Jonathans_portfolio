I founded Tixy-NFT in early 2022 together with my Co-Founders Alrashid Raad and Nora Bj√∂rk. The immense scope of building, deploying, and running a tech startup taught me more lessons than all my years in school combined. With that said, being a part of KTH-Innovation and Sting, was of great benefit when trying to navigate the stormy waters of entrepreneurship. 
\nBuilding Tixy-NFT by myself in only a couple of months was the hardest thing I've done so far. This also had to be done while simultaneously talking to customers, managing legal company bureaucracy, and pitching to VC firms and Angel investors.
\n We officially launched the Tixy-NFT Beta in June 2022 right before Sting demo day. Now anyone could deploy buy, sell, transfer and authenticate NFTs without needing a crypto wallet, crypto-currency, or any other knowledge about crypto. Tixy-NFT removed all the complexity by having our own safe, encrypted custodian wallets and by using Stripe to manage the flow of payments between merchants and customers. Buying an NFT could now be done in seconds and then be traded or transferred to any wallet of the user's choosing. 
\n The stack used for Tixy-NFT was based on a combination of, Next.Js, Firebase, and the Google Cloud Platform. The reasoning behind this was the vast amount of documentation available and also the possibility to use the same backend infrastructure for a potential Flutter mobile app.

If I could summarize myself in two words they would definitely be, always curious. Technology has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. From getting my first Gameboy to building my first computer and writing my first program. Computers, science, and technology have been a source of immense curiosity for me.

When the gears of the world economy start to run slower new opportunities also present themselves!
Companies are more than ever looking for effective cost-cutting measures. This means that the mathematical field of optimization can help companies reduce unnecessary spending. 
However, the number of products producing practical value from the theoretical models in the optimization space is few and far in between. 
\n Tixy-Logistics leverages, machine learning, and mathematical systems theory together with an efficient user interface to optimize decision-making and task delegation for logistical facilities.
